### What I learned

This was my first Frontend Mentor challenge and a great introduction to writing clean HTML and CSS. I practiced:

- Structuring a simple HTML layout

- Making a fully responsive design

It helped me get comfortable with the basics of building and styling a small web component from scratch.
