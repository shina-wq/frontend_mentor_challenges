## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Working on this project helped me better understand Flexbox and how to align items properly. I also practiced using CSS properties like gap to create spacing without relying on extra margins.

Here's an example of a small CSS trick I used:

```css
.description {
    font-size: 16px;
    color: #555;
    margin-bottom: 8px; /* Added spacing below the description tag */ 
}
```
I also learned how to properly structure a simple card layout while keeping it responsive across different screen sizes.
