# Frontend Mentor Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to various challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/), a platform that provides realistic frontend development projects to help improve coding skills through practice.

## 📌 Purpose

These challenges are a core part of my learning journey as I continue to build and refine my frontend development skills. Each project helps me strengthen my understanding of semantic HTML, modern CSS, responsive design, and JavaScript fundamentals.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- Git & GitHub for version control

## 🗂️ Structure

Each challenge is organized in its own directory and typically includes:
- My completed solution
- Screenshots or preview images
- A link to the live demo (if deployed)

## 🚀 Live Projects

Where applicable, solutions are deployed and accessible via GitHub Pages or other platforms. Live links are included in each project's README.
